# Google Search Plugin API

This is an API for a Google Search plugin that can be used with chat-gpt. It allows users to search Google and fetch HTML content from the results.
I opted for t3-stack because the input and output of the plugin are pretty simple


## Get your API keys from Google

Create API credentials: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
Get your Programmable Search Engine Key: https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create
Use these in your .env

This plugin is basically a port from https://github.com/Sogody/google-chatgpt-plugin 

## OpenAPI Specification

This API is documented using the OpenAPI specification (version 3.0.3). The specification file is located in the `yaml` file named `google-search-plugin-api.yaml`.

## Getting Started

#### `GET /api/search`

This endpoint searches Google using the provided query and returns the search results, along with the inner text of the first link.
